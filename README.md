## Theory
### Ceasar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
To create the substitution table, we write the keyword under the alphabet letters, starting with the letter whose numerical code matches the selected numerical key K. The remaining substitution alphabet letters are written in alphabetical order (avoiding letter repetition) after the keyword. Upon reaching the end of the table, we cyclically return to its beginning and append the last letters of the alphabet not encountered earlier.
